        <p>Welcome to WhiteHat Jr, where kids become introverts, We want to strip kids from playing outside and having
            fun, and making them code and cry. <br>
            The funny thing is, We do not teach them correct stuff also, We ourself dont know how to code, we just wanna
            stack up those millions, our teachers have never built a project in their life! So now that you know all
            this, keep scrolling.

        <p align="center">This brand doesnt know what they teach, that teacher told me that java is a high programming
            language
            typed in c++, and she did not know what stack overflowm geek for geeks or leetcode means, I mean
            even a 15 year old developer will know so, dont enroll your children in this ever ü§Æ
